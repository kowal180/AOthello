# AOthello by Nathan Kowalski

Hello! My name is Nathan Kowalski.
Welcome to my submission for this years Atomic Accelerator challenge!

This submission was made in Python and extends the provided `python_sdk`

## Notes

Here's a little information about how my submission is organized:
- client.py = a slightly modified version of the client.py file provided
- support.py = a file that contains support classes for the system.
- player.py = a file containing the player. The player pulls together all the classes to make the 'brains' of the operation.
- /tests = a directory containing tests for all functions used
